Proxy Pattern


Definition:
The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

Real-life Example:
A Bank Account can be represented by a proxy that controls access to the account details. Only authorized users can access sensitive data.


Real Subject --> Proxy --> Client


Efficiency & Robustness Features:

Access Control: Proxy ensures only authenticated access to sensitive data.
Lazy Initialization: The real subject is only accessed when necessary.
