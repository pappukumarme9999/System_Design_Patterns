Facade Pattern

Definition:
The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

Real-life Example:
A Home Theater System has multiple components (TV, Sound System, etc.), but the Facade can provide a simplified interface to control the whole system.

Subsystem Classes --> Facade --> Client


Efficiency & Robustness Features:

Simplified Interface: Users donâ€™t need to deal with subsystem complexities.
Subsystem Management: Allows encapsulating complex operations into simple methods.
