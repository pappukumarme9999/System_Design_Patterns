Composite Pattern
Definition:
The Composite Pattern allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It enables creating tree-like structures where individual objects and composites can be treated the same way.

Real-life Example:
A file system where a directory can contain both files and subdirectories, and both can be treated the same way.


Component (FileSystemItem) --> Leaf (File) & Composite (Directory)



Efficiency & Robustness Features:

Unified Management: Both files and directories are handled uniformly.

Recursive Structure: Easy to handle complex structures with recursion.

The Composite Pattern allows for efficient traversal of tree-like structures, as it can be implemented using recursion.
