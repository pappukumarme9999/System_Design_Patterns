Definition:
The Decorator Pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

Real-life Example:
A coffee can be enhanced by adding ingredients such as milk, sugar, or cream, without changing the base coffee class.

Component --> Concrete Component & Decorator --> Concrete Decorators


Efficiency & Robustness Features:

Flexible Object Composition: Allows adding responsibilities dynamically.
Composability: Multiple decorators can be applied independently.
