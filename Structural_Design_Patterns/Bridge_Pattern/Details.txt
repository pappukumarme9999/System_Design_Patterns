Bridge Pattern
Definition:
The Bridge Pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. It separates the abstraction and implementation into separate class hierarchies.

Real-life Example:
Consider a Remote Control as an abstraction that controls devices such as a TV or a Radio. The implementation of turning devices on/off can differ for each device.


Abstraction --> Bridge --> Implementation



Efficiency & Robustness Features:

Separation of Concerns: Decoupling the abstraction from its implementation makes it easier to maintain and extend.
Enhanced Extendability: You can add more device types or remote types without affecting the existing code.
