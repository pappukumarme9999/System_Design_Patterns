Flyweight Pattern
Definition:
The Flyweight Pattern is used to minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. This is typically used for large numbers of objects.

Real-life Example:
In a text editor, every character typed is an object. Instead of creating a new object for each instance of 'a', the system can reuse the same 'a' object.


FlyweightFactory --> Flyweight (Shared Object)



Efficiency & Robustness Features:

Memory Optimization: Reduces the number of objects created by sharing.
Lazy Initialization: Flyweight objects are created only when needed.
