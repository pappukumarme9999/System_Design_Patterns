 Prototype Pattern
Definition:
Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, instead of creating new instances from scratch.

Use Case:
When object creation is costly (in terms of time or resources) and you want to avoid creating the same object repeatedly.

Real-Life Example:
Imagine a car dealership that produces high-end cars. Each car has many parts and customizations. Instead of creating each car from scratch, you clone an existing car and modify the necessary features.

Real-Life Application:
Document Templates: Copying pre-existing document templates with small modifications.
3D Modeling: Duplicating 3D models in a game or design software for quick customization.
