Singleton Pattern


Definition:
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

Use Case:
When you need to manage a single instance of a class for the entire application, such as logging, configuration settings, or database connections.

Real-Life Example:
Imagine a printer in an office. Everyone needs to use the same printer, and we donâ€™t want multiple instances of the printer being used at the same time.

Real-Life Application:
Database Connection Pooling: Only one instance of a database connection pool is created to manage all connections in the application.
Logger Classes: There should be one log file written to by the entire system, avoiding multiple log instances.
