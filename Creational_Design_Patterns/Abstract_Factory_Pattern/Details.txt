Abstract Factory Pattern


Definition:
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Use Case:
When you want to create a group of related objects, and the concrete types of those objects vary, but they must all adhere to a common theme.

Real-Life Example:
Imagine you are designing a furniture store. Depending on the style (Modern, Victorian), you will need a consistent set of furniture, such as chairs and tables.


Real-Life Application:
UI Themes: Creating themed components like buttons, windows, and sliders that adhere to a specific look and feel (e.g., dark mode vs. light mode).
Cross-platform Libraries: Libraries that generate UI elements for different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) using abstract factories.
