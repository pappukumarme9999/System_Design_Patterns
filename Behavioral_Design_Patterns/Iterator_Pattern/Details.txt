Iterator Pattern
Definition:
The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

Real-life Example:
Iterating through a list of songs in a playlist.


Iterator --> ConcreteIterator
Aggregate --> ConcreteAggregate


Use Case:
Navigating through a collection (e.g., a list, tree, or graph).
Simplifying the traversal of complex data structures.


Robustness Features:
Safe Traversal: Ensure thread safety when iterating over collections.
Lazy Loading: Implement lazy evaluation for large data sets.
