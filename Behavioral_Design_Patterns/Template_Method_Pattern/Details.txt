Template Method Pattern
Definition:
The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithmâ€™s structure.

Real-life Example:
Recipe App: Different recipes follow the same basic template, but the steps can vary.


Abstract Class <--> ConcreteClass1, ConcreteClass2


Use Case:
Processing algorithms in frameworks.
Workflow systems where basic steps are predefined, but some steps are customizable.


Robustness Features:
Reusable Algorithm Skeleton: Core algorithm remains unchanged, but certain steps can be customized.
Avoids Code Duplication: Reduces redundancy by using a template for similar operations.
