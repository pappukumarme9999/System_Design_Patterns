Chain of Responsibility Pattern
Definition:
The Chain of Responsibility Pattern creates a chain of receiver objects for a request. This pattern decouples the sender and receiver of a request, giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.

Real-life Example:
Helpdesk System: A helpdesk system where requests are escalated through a chain of handlers based on priority.


Handler <--> NextHandler <--> ConcreteHandler1, ConcreteHandler2



Use Case:
Logging frameworks that allow different levels of logging (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).
Support systems where a request is passed through different levels of support.
Handling HTTP requests at different levels in a web server.

Robustness Features:
Request Processing Flexibility: Requests can be handled by multiple objects in sequence.
Decoupling: Decouples the sender and receiver, allowing for more flexible processing chains.
Dynamic Handler Chain: Easily modify the chain without changing the existing code.
Error Handling: Ensure that a fallback handler processes any request that isnâ€™t handled.
