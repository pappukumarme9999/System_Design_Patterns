Mediator Pattern
Definition:
The Mediator Pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. The mediator centralizes complex communications and controls the interaction between collaborating objects.

Real-life Example:
Air Traffic Control: ATC coordinates communication between different aircraft to ensure they donâ€™t collide and follow the right flight paths.


Colleague <--> Mediator <--> Colleague


Use Case:
Chat applications where a central chat room (mediator) manages communication between multiple users.
Coordinating complex workflows in GUI-based applications.


Robustness Features:
Decoupling of Colleagues: Mediator centralizes communication logic, which makes the system easier to maintain.
Scalability: It simplifies adding new components (colleagues) to the system.
