Memento Pattern
Definition:
The Memento Pattern captures and externalizes an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later without violating encapsulation.

Real-life Example:
Undo functionality in text editors.


Originator <--> Memento <--> Caretaker



Use Case:
Implementing undo/redo operations.
Managing state history in applications like games or document editors.


Robustness Features:
Undo/Redo: Easily implements undo/redo functionality.
Encapsulation: Memento doesn’t expose the internal state of objects.
