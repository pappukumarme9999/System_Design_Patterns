Strategy Pattern
Definition:
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

Real-life Example:
Payment System: A system where you can choose from multiple payment strategies such as credit card, PayPal, or crypto.


Context <--> Strategy (many algorithms)


Use Case:
Payment gateways in e-commerce platforms.
Sorting algorithms in software.


Robustness Features:
Algorithm Flexibility: Easily switch between algorithms at runtime.
Open/Closed Principle: New algorithms can be added without modifying existing code.
