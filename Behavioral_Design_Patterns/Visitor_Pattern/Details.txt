Visitor Pattern
Definition:
The Visitor Pattern represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. The visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

Real-life Example:
Tax Calculation: A tax system where different tax rates are applied to different types of goods.


Visitor <--> Concrete Element1, Concrete Element2


Use Case:
Applying operations to a family of objects (e.g., discount calculations on a shopping cart).
Extending functionality in large object structures without modifying existing classes.


Robustness Features:
Extensibility: Easily add new operations without modifying existing object structures.
Separation of Concerns: Logic of the operation is separated from the object structure.
