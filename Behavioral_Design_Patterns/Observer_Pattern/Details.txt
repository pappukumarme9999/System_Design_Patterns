Observer Pattern
Definition:
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Real-life Example:
News Subscription: Users subscribe to a news channel and get updates when new content is published.

Subject <--> Observer (1-to-many)


Use Case:
Event handling in GUI frameworks.
Notification systems in applications like news apps or social media.
